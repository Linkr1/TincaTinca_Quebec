Extended title: Population genomic analyses of an invasive population of Tench (Tinca tinca) spreading within and beyond Quebec, Canada. 

Description: This repository provides data and code associated with a population genomic analyses of an invasive population of Tench (Tinca tinca) focused on one population in eastern North America. It is published as: "Genetic diversity and structure of a recent fish invasion: Tench (Tinca tinca) in eastern North America. 

It contains the following data files:  
-genotype file: Final_Filtered_recode.vcf  
-sample description: Final_Coordinates.csv  
-geographic distances: LCW_distance.csv
